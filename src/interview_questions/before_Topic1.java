    //
    //o-) The change is welcomed. For example, after the sprint demo if client does not like something, we can take their
    //feedback and improve the product. Requirement change is OK.
    //o-) Since it is iterative development process, the development team can developed piece of functionality, get feedback
    //and improve next iteration. So, the product will be continuously improve.
    //o-) Waste is eliminated in agile with the help of scrum master. For example, if I am blocked, I don’t have to wait and waste my time.
    //Since team members communicates with each other efficiently we can be more productive by preventing duplicated effort.
    //o-) Waterfall emphasizes tools and platform, like C# .NET, but agile emphasizes people. You can have best tool but at the end people are using those tools.

    //
    //• Graphic representation of the rate at which work is completed and how much work remains to be done
    //
    //7-What is User Story?
    //* (Note: basically, a user story is just a requirement) User story is a short simple description minimum shippable product.
    //* It normally looks like this: As <end-user> I want to do < action> So that I can <benefit>.
    //o As amazon user I should able to login, so I can buy stuffs online
    //What is an Epic?
    //    * Epic is a big user story that you cannot complete in one sprint.
    //    * For example, as a user I want to buy online so I don’t have to visit the local store. This story is too big,
    //    and it cannot be completed in one sprint. So, we can call it Epic instead of user story. It should be divided to multiple user stories like:
    //o As a customer I want to be able to login so I can view my account.
    // o As a customer I want to be able to search for a product so I can buy them.
    // o As a customer I want to be able to proceed to checkout so I can pay for the item that I am going to buy.
    //o As a customer I want to be able to logout so I can protect my account.
    // o As you can see< As a customer I want to be able to buy...> can be divided to multiple user stories. The team can pick
    //one or more user story in every sprint.
    //
    //8--What is Acceptance criteria?
    //* Acceptance criteria is the way that we know the user story is successfully developed or not.
    //* Statements of requirements that are described from the point of view of the user to determine when a story is ”done” and working as expected
    //9-What is difference between Front End Testing and Back End testing?
    //
    //Front End Testing is performed on the Graphical User Interface, whereas Back End Testing involves databases testing.
    // Front end consist of web site look where user can interact whereas in case of back end it is the database
    // which is required to store the data.When ender user enters data in GUI of the front-end application,
    // then this entered data is stored in the database. To save this data into the database we write SQL queries.
    //
    //10-What is increment? Explain
    //
    //•	An increment is the total of all the product backlogs items completed during a sprint.
    //* Each increment includes all the previous sprint increment values as it is cumulative.
    //* It must be in the available mode in the subsequent release as it is a step to reach our goal.
